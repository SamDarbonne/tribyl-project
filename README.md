Coding project for Tribyl

### To run:

1.) ```npm install```

2.) ```yarn start```

I used create-react-app in the interest of time to get things moving faster, even though it has obviously given me a much bulkier app than needed for this project. Almost all work I did is in the following files:
```
landing_page.jsx
edit_modal.jsx
pain_points.jsx
```
